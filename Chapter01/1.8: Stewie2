Write a complete Java program in a class named Stewie2 that prints the following output. Use at least one static method besides main to remove redundancy.

//////////////////////
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
|| Victory is mine! ||
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

SOLUTION:

public class Stewie2 {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        printTop();
        printBottom();
        printBottom();
        printBottom();
        printBottom();
        printBottom();
       
    }
    
    public static void printTop(){
        
       System.out.println("//////////////////////");
        
    }
    
    public static void printBottom(){
        
        System.out.println("|| Victory is mine! ||");
        System.out.println("\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\");
        
    }
}
