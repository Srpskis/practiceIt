Write a complete Java program in a class named WellFormed that prints the following output:

A well-formed Java program has
a main method with { and }
braces.

A System.out.println statement
has ( and ) and usually a
String that starts and ends
with a " character.
(But we type \" instead!)


ANSWER:

public class WellFormed {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        System.out.println(printThis());

    }

    public static String printThis(){

        return "A well-formed Java program has \n" +
                "a main method with { and } \n" +
                "braces. \n\n" +
                "A System.out.println statement \n" +
                "has ( and ) and usually a \n" +
                "String that starts and ends \n" +
                "with a \" character. \n" +
                "(But we type \\\" instead!)";
    }
    
}
